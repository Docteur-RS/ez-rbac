# ez-rbac
RBAC manager for kubernetes

RBAC is love, RBAC is sweet but RBAC can choke you to death in your sleep.  
To prevent the last one you can use this python3 script to generate RBAC configs and deal with all the fuzzy command lines of "contexts", "service accounts", "credentials", etc


THIS IS NOT FINISHED YET  
Use at your own risks
